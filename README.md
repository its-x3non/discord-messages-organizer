# Discord Messages Organizer
This program organizes your messages by date so you can see your first ever message you've sent!

This uses the data you've requested from Discord, so if you don't know how, here is a link showing you [how to request your data](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360004027692-Requesting-a-Copy-of-your-Data).  
It takes at least 30 days for you to get your data from Discord.

## How to use
After you download the .exe file from release, drag and drop it to your package folder just like this:
